Agents use Mulch — Mulch does not use agents.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g mulch-cli\n```\n\nOr use directly with npx — no install required:\n\n```bash\nnpx mulch-cli <command>\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\nmulch init                                            # Create .mulch/ in your project\nmulch add database                                    # Add a domain\nmulch record database --type convention \"Use WAL mode for SQLite\"\nmulch record database --type failure \\\n  --description \"VACUUM inside a transaction causes silent corruption\" \\\n  --resolution \"Always run VACUUM outside transaction boundaries\"\nmulch query database                                  # See accumulated expertise\nmulch prime                                           # Get full context for agent injection\nmulch prime database                                  # Get context for one domain only\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n```\n1. mulch init               → Creates .mulch/ with domain JSONL files\n2. Agent reads expertise     → Grounded in everything the project has learned\n3. Agent does work           → Normal task execution\n4. Agent records insights    → Before finishing, writes learnings back to .mulch/\n5. git push                  → Teammates' agents get smarter too\n```\n\nThe critical insight: step 4 is **agent-driven**. Before completing a task, the agent reviews its work for insights worth preserving and calls `mulch record`. Mulch provides the schema and file structure so those learnings land in a consistent, queryable format.\n\n## What's in `.mulch/`\n\n```\n.mulch/\n├── expertise/\n│   ├── database.jsonl        # All database knowledge\n│   ├── api.jsonl             # One JSONL file per domain\n│   └── testing.jsonl         # Each line is a typed, structured record\n└── mulch.config.yaml         # Config: domains, governance settings\n```\n\nEverything is git-tracked. Clone a repo and your agents immediately have the project's accumulated expertise.\n\n## CLI Reference\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `mulch init` | Initialize `.mulch/` in the current project |\n| `mulch add <domain>` | Add a new expertise domain |\n| `mulch record <domain> --type <type>` | Record an expertise record (`--tags`, `--force`, `--relates-to`, `--supersedes`) |\n| `mulch edit <domain> <id>` | Edit an existing record by ID or 1-based index |\n| `mulch delete <domain> <id>` | Delete a record by ID or 1-based index |\n| `mulch query [domain]` | Query expertise (use `--all` for all domains) |\n| `mulch prime [domains...]` | Output AI-optimized expertise context (multi-domain, `--context`, `--format`, `--export`) |\n| `mulch search [query]` | Search records across domains (`--domain`, `--type`, `--tag` filters) |\n| `mulch compact [domain]` | Analyze compaction candidates or apply a compaction (`--analyze`, `--apply`) |\n| `mulch status` | Show expertise freshness and counts |\n| `mulch validate` | Schema validation across all files |\n| `mulch doctor` | Run health checks on expertise records (`--fix` to auto-fix) |\n| `mulch setup [provider]` | Install provider-specific hooks (claude, cursor, codex, gemini, windsurf, aider) |\n| `mulch onboard` | Generate AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md snippet |\n| `mulch prune` | Remove stale tactical/observational entries |\n| `mulch ready` | Show recently added or updated records (`--since`, `--domain`, `--limit`) |\n| `mulch sync` | Validate, stage, and commit `.mulch/` changes |\n| `mulch learn` | Show changed files and suggest domains for recording learnings |\n\n## Record Types\n\n| Type | Required Fields | Use Case |\n|------|----------------|----------|\n| `convention` | content | \"Use WAL mode for SQLite connections\" |\n| `pattern` | name, description | Named patterns with optional file references |\n| `failure` | description, resolution | What went wrong and how to avoid it |\n| `decision` | title, rationale | Architectural decisions and their reasoning |\n| `reference` | name, description | Key files, endpoints, or resources worth remembering |\n| `guide` | name, description | Step-by-step procedures for recurring tasks |\n\nAll records support optional `--classification` (foundational / tactical / observational), evidence flags (`--evidence-commit`, `--evidence-issue`, `--evidence-file`), `--tags`, `--relates-to`, and `--supersedes` for linking.\n\n## Example Output\n\n```\n$ mulch query database","is_error":false}]},"uuid":"6c9234bb-2188-4527-ac87-1673f7b5a35b","timestamp":"2026-02-12T16:10:44.134Z"},"normalizedMessages":[],"type":"agent_progress","prompt":"Explore the mulch project to understand what a changelog would look like.

Now I have all the information needed. Let me compile a comprehensive report.\n\n## Changelog Exploration Report for Mulch\n\nBased on my thorough exploration, here are all the findings:\n\n### 1. CHANGELOG Status\n**No CHANGELOG.md exists yet.** The project only has files in `node_modules/` and no dedicated changelog file in the repo root.\n\n### 2. Git History (Last 30 Commits)\nThe project has a clean, well-organized commit history with **48 total commits**. Recent commits show a pattern of:\n- Version bump commits (explicit \"Bump version to X.Y.Z\" messages)\n- Feature/fix commits with clear descriptions\n- Mulch expertise recordings (meta-tracking using the tool itself)\n\n### 3. Current Version & Package Info\n- **Current version**: `0.2.4` (in package.json)\n- **Package name**: `mulch-cli`\n- **npm registry**: Published to npmjs.org\n- **Node requirement**: `>=18`\n- **Type**: ESM module (`\"type\": \"module\"`)\n- **Scripts**: build, dev, test, test:watch, lint\n\n### 4. Versioning Pattern\nSemantic versioning is used with explicit version bumps in `package.json`:\n- `v0.1.0` - Initial release\n- `v0.2.0` - Major feature/command additions\n- `v0.2.1` - Messaging sync improvements\n- `v0.2.2` - ID-based record addressing refactor\n- `v0.2.3` - Added `mulch update` command & version check\n- `v0.2.4` - Concurrency safety (atomic writes & file locking)\n\n### 5. CI/CD Workflow\n**Two GitHub Actions workflows exist**:\n\n**publish.yml** - Automated npm publishing on version bump:\n- Triggers on pushes to `main`\n- Checks if local version differs from npm version\n- Publishes with `--provenance` flag\n- **Auto-tags releases** with git tags (`v0.2.4`, etc.)\n- Requires npm token secret\n\n**ci.yml** - Standard CI pipeline:\n- Runs on PRs and pushes to `main`\n- Steps: lint → build → test\n\n### 6. Git Tags\nFour release tags exist:\n- `v0.1.0`\n- `v0.2.0`\n- `v0.2.3`\n- `v0.2.4`\n\n(v0.2.1 and v0.2.2 were not tagged in the past but the workflow now auto-tags all releases)\n\n### 7. Recent Commit Structure (v0.2.3 → v0.2.4)\nThe commits between versions show the changelog-worthy changes:\n\n**v0.2.4 (Feb 10-12, 2026):**\n- Add atomic JSONL writes and advisory file locking for concurrency safety\n- Document concurrency & multi-agent safety across README, CLAUDE.md, and onboard snippet\n- Fix CI: build before test so update tests find dist/cli.js\n- Multi-commit feature addition with supporting documentation\n\n**v0.2.3:**\n- Add mulch update command and version check in doctor\n- Make mulch onboard idempotent with marker-based section updates\n\n**v0.2.2:**\n- Standardize on ID-based record addressing\n\n**v0.2.1:**\n- Sync messaging across all surfaces\n- Rebalance expertise\n\n**v0.2.0 (Major):**\n- Add new commands, record types, and make prime default to compact output\n- Added reference/guide record types, multi-domain prime, search, compact mode\n\n### 8. Project Characteristics\n- **Type**: CLI tool (no LLM dependency)\n- **Key domains**: commands, schemas, utils, tests\n- **Quality practices**: \n  - Uses Mulch itself for expertise tracking (\"mulch: record...\" commits)\n  - Comprehensive test suite (53+ tests across 5 files per CLAUDE.md)\n  - Type-strict TypeScript (no `any`, strict mode)\n  - Follows specific ESM conventions (.js imports, Ajv interop)\n\n### 9. Commit Categorization Pattern\nBased on recent commits, changelog should capture:\n- **Features**: New commands, new options, new record types\n- **Fixes**: CI fixes, bug fixes, flaky test fixes\n- **Docs**: README updates, inline documentation, agent prompting improvements\n- **Internal**: Expertise rebalancing, expertise recordings\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Changelog Approach\n\nBased on these findings, a CHANGELOG.md would:\n\n1. **Use version sections** (Unreleased / v0.2.4 / v0.2.3 / etc.)\n2. **Group commits by category**: Features, Fixes, Docs, Breaking Changes\n3. **Include commit SHAs** for reference (since they're auto-tagged now)\n4. **Start from v0.1.0** and work forward\n5. **Leverage the auto-tagging workflow** — changelog generation could be automated alongside releases\n6. **Link to git tags** for detailed diffs\n\nThe project is well-structured for changelog automation since:\n- Version bumps are explicit and consistent\n- Workflow already auto-tags releases\n- Commits follow descriptive patterns\n- No breaking changes in v0.2.x series (appears to be pre-1.0)"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a15825e (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 27825\ntool_uses: 28\nduration_ms: 40725</usage>"}]}]},"uuid":"026d137d-e4e0-430e-a0e4-648fe39a62bf","timestamp":"2026-02-12T16:11:00.450Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the mulch project to understand what a changelog would look like.
